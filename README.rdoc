= Tartarus

It is a deep, gloomy place, a pit, or an abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering..

Tartarus provides logging to your database for exceptions triggered by the users of 
your Rails application. A generator is included that will give you a clean interface 
to view and manage the exceptions.

=== Dependencies

If you wish to use the generator to build the exception viewing/manging interface, the following 
dependencies are used:

* will_paginate
* jquery

=== Installation

1. Install the gem from:
    gem install tartarus
2. Add the tartarus gem dependency to your enviroment.rb:
     config.gem "tartarus"
3. Run the generator from the root of your Rails application:
     script/generate tartarus
4. Run the migration that was generated:
     rake db:migrate
5. Add the javascript and stylesheet includes in your layout:
     <script type="text/javascript" src="/javascripts/tartarus.jquery.js"></script>
     <link href="/stylesheets/tartarus.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
